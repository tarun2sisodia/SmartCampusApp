2. **Economic**: Cost-effective with open-source tools and automation.
3. **Operational**: User-friendly design with minimal training required.

## System Design
### Architecture
- **3-Tier Architecture**: Presentation (Flutter), Application (Supabase), and Data (PostgreSQL).
- **Admin Panel**: Integrated with specific admin-level UI and logic.

### Diagrams
- **E-R Diagram**: Visualizes entities and relationships.
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Illustrates data flow through the system.

## System Requirements
- **Hardware**: Generic requirements.
- **Software**: Flutter SDK, Dart, GetX, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and development IDEs.

## Testing
### Types of Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Validates individual components.
